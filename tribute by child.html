            Tribute to My Mommy <br><br>
            Nana, you were my safe haven, the one I ran to every time Aunty Keziah threatened to scold me. I can still hear your comforting voice, always ready to ease my worries. I remember the day you thought I had gone missing. I had snuck into a neighbor’s room and kept quiet for so long that you walked miles searching for me, convinced I was lost. When you finally found me, you said, “If you hadn’t come back, nobody would have eaten in this house today!” Your love and concern always made me feel valued and cherished.<br><br>           
            I also remember our outings together. Every time we stepped out, I would spot something I wanted to buy, and you would sigh and playfully complain, “Why do you always want to buy everything you see?” Your humor made those moments special, turning simple errands into cherished memories filled with laughter.<br><br>         
            Your sense of humor was infectious. You had an uncanny ability to make everyone laugh, even in tough times. I’ll never forget how you would crack jokes at the dinner table, lightening the mood and bringing us all together.<br><br>          
            Thank you, Nana, for your endless love, your warmth, and your laughter. You will forever hold a special place in my heart.<br><br>
            Your little one!<br><br>
